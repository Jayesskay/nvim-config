# My Neovim Config - Because Vim Is So Last Year 🤣

Welcome to my neovim config, the fastest text editor in the west 🤠 (and the east ➡️, and the north ⬆️, and the south ⬇️) 

If you're tired of using 😫💤
- slow 🐌 
- clunky 💩
- productive ⚙️

memory hogs 🐷 like IntelliJ 🤢 or Visual Studio 🤮 then you've come to the right place ✅

## Features 👌
- 🔥 Blazingly fast startup time 🚀
- 🎨 Sleek and stylish coding experience with my custom fork of the Darcula color scheme 🖌️

## Installation 🧑‍🔧
- Clone to `~/.config/nvim/` 👽
- ... ⏳
- PROFIT 🤑💵

## Roadmap 🗺️

The future of my neovim config is bright, and I'm excited to share my plans with you. 
Here's what's on the horizon 🌅

### Short-term Goals ⏱️
- Add more custom key bindings for even faster navigation ⌨️
- Add more plugins for enchanced developer experience 🔌
- Improve the documentation so it's easier for newcomers to get started 📃

### Long-term Goals ⏳
- Rewrite it in Rust 🦀 for even blazingler 🔥 performance and memory safety 🔐
